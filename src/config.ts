  aboutMe:
    "I’m a passionate and detail-oriented Computer Science student currently in my third year, maintaining a GPA of 3.75. My main expertise lies in front-end development with HTML, CSS, and a growing focus on crafting seamless user interfaces. Along the way, I’ve also explored Python, SQL, and the back-end side of development, giving me a well-rounded understanding of how everything connects behind the scenes. Now I am looking for an internship opportunity where I can contribute my technical skills, creativity, and enthusiasm for learning to real-world projects — while continuing to grow as a developer.",
